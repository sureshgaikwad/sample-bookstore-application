  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "rating": 5,
    "reviewerName": "Test User",
    "comment": "Amazing book!"
  }'

# Get average rating
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/books/1/ratings/average
```

## 🔄 Version History & Revert Instructions

### Baseline Version (v1.0-baseline)
The application was tagged before adding the rating feature for easy rollback.

### To Revert to Pre-Rating Version:
```bash
# Option 1: Reset to baseline tag
git checkout v1.0-baseline

# Option 2: Create new branch from baseline
git checkout -b revert-to-baseline v1.0-baseline

# Option 3: View what changed
git diff v1.0-baseline main
```

### Files Added/Modified:
**New Files:**
- `src/main/java/com/bookstore/model/Rating.java`
- `src/main/java/com/bookstore/repository/RatingRepository.java`
- `src/main/java/com/bookstore/service/RatingService.java`

**Modified Files:**
- `src/main/java/com/bookstore/model/Book.java` - Added rating relationship and helper methods
- `src/main/java/com/bookstore/controller/BookController.java` - Added rating endpoints
- `src/main/java/com/bookstore/config/DataInitializer.java` - Added sample ratings
- `src/main/resources/templates/books/list.html` - Added rating display to book cards
- `src/main/resources/templates/books/details.html` - Added comprehensive rating section

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Database Schema
```sql
-- New ratings table
CREATE TABLE ratings (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    rating INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5),
    reviewer_name VARCHAR(255),
    comment VARCHAR(1000),
    book_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(id)
);
```

### Rating Calculation Logic
- **Average Rating**: Calculated in real-time from all ratings for a book
- **Star Display**: Full stars (★) and empty stars (☆) based on average
- **Rating Count**: Total number of ratings submitted

### Security Considerations
- Input validation for rating values (1-5)
- XSS protection in comment display
- Duplicate rating prevention per reviewer
- Form validation on frontend and backend

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Visual Elements
- **Star Icons**: Unicode stars (★☆) for universal compatibility
- **Bootstrap Styling**: Responsive design with cards and forms
- **Color Coding**: Warning color (#ffc107) for stars
- **Interactive Forms**: Show/hide rating submission form

### User Experience
- **Immediate Feedback**: Success/error messages for rating submission
- **Real-time Updates**: Page refresh after rating submission
- **Intuitive Interface**: Clear star selection and comment areas
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## 📈 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
- User authentication for rating attribution
- Rating moderation and flagging system
- Sorting ratings by date, rating value, or helpfulness
- Average rating history and trends
- Integration with user profiles and reading lists
- Advanced rating analytics and reporting

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **No User Authentication**: Ratings are tied to names, not authenticated users
2. **Basic Duplicate Prevention**: Based on name matching only
3. **No Rating Moderation**: All ratings are immediately visible
4. **Limited Validation**: Basic validation for rating values and names
5. **No Rating Helpfulness**: No way to mark ratings as helpful/unhelpful
